## F2016

First game where i was the primary coder. We had 3 writers on the team so we made a text adventure. Game was made with unity.

## S2017

First game that i did not code on. Did mainly music and a little bit of level design. Game was made with unity.

## F2017

The legendary chinchilla hospital. I was the sole coder on this game. It was written in c in a few hours, then ported over to c++ to get some special functionality. A ascii game that is more than it seems.

## S2018

First attempt at a 3d game. I focused on level design and did some assets while the other programmer focused on making assets and did some level design. Made with unity.

## F2018

Second time with a team of one. First foray into making a multiplayer game. Tried to keep it short and sweet. Ended up getting some allumni to make art and music for me.
